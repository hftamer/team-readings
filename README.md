### Purpose

This repository contains a list of my notes on the re-engagement team's (optional) assigned 1:1 readings. At the start of each round of 1:1s, the team will be assigned a reading to complete. These readings are generally about 
a technology, methodology, or engineer experience relevant to the work we do at HelloFresh.

### Goals

There are a few goals these readings hope to achieve:

1. challenge or expand an engineer's current understanding of a particular technology or methodology
2. educate an engineer about a new technology or methodology
3. develop an engineer's ability to reason about solutions to a problem and adequately discuss each solution's tradeoffs
4. develop an engineer's ability to incorporate new technologies or processes into their development work at HelloFresh.

I've open sourced my notes to allow the team to collectively benefit from them and to harness the advantages of open source and collaborative software development by
allowing the team to contribute to the notes and collectively learn from them.

At the start of each 1:1 cycle, I'll publish a basic template of the reading's document and at the end of it, I'll publish my notes. This is done to encourage team members to actually read the reading and not just wait on the notes :) 

### Discussion

In our 1:1, we will discuss the reading that was assigned at the end of the previous 1:1 if one was assigned. Re-engagement engineers should come to the 1:1 prepared to answer the following questions about the reading:

1. What do you see as the pros and cons of the technology/methodology discussed in the reading?
2. Is it possible to incorporate the technology/methodology we were reading about into our development?
3. If it is possible, _should_ we incorporate it?
    - Why or why not?
4. If we should incorporate it, _how_ do we go about doing so at HelloFresh in a way that aligns with the HelloFresh DNA?
5. What potential issues do you foresee with the technology/methodology?

### Organization

Inside of the `/readings` folder, there will be a Markdown document for each reading. Inside of the Markdown document,
there will be a link to the original source reading as well as my personal notes on the reading. 

### Contributing
