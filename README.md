### Purpose

This repository contains a list of the re-engagement team's (optional) assigned 1:1 readings with my notes on them. At the 
start of each 1:1 round, each member of the team will be assigned a reading to complete. These readings are generally about 
a technology or methodology relevant to the work we do here at HelloFresh. The goal of these readings is to expand every team
members' knowledge across our entire stack of work. 

I've open sourced these my notes to allow the team to collectively benefit from these notes and to harness the advantages of open source by
allowing the team to contribute to the notes if necessary. 

At the start of each 1:1 cycle, I'll publish a basic template of the reading's document and at the end of it, I'll
publish my notes. This is done to encourage team members to actually read the reading and not just wait on the notes :) 

### Organization

Inside of the `/readings` folder, there will be a Markdown document for each reading. Inside of the Markdown document,
there will be a link to the original source reading as well as my personal notes on the reading. 

### Contributing

Simply create a pull request with your changes and I'll review and merge it.
