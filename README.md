### Purpose

This repository contains a list of my personal notes on the re-engagement team's (optional) assigned 1:1 readings. At the start of each round of 1:1s, the team will be assigned a reading to complete. These readings are generally about 
a technology, methodology, or engineer experience relevant to the work we do at HelloFresh.

### Goals

There are a few goals these readings hope to achieve:

1. challenge or expand an engineer's current understanding of a particular technology or methodology
2. educate an engineer about a new technology or methodology
3. develop an engineer's ability to reason about solutions to a problem and adequately discuss their tradeoffs

I've open sourced these my notes to allow the team to collectively benefit from them and to harness the advantages of open source by
allowing the team to contribute to the notes and collectively learn from them.

At the start of each 1:1 cycle, I'll publish a basic template of the reading's document and at the end of it, I'll publish my notes. This is done to encourage team members to actually read the reading and not just wait on the notes :) 

### Organization

Inside of the `/readings` folder, there will be a Markdown document for each reading. Inside of the Markdown document,
there will be a link to the original source reading as well as my personal notes on the reading. 

### Contributing

Simply create a pull request with your changes against `master` and I'll review it. Once code review passes, I'll merge your changes. Please make sure your branch is up to date with `master` before asking for review.
